## Development setup

Use a Python 3.12+ build that supports SQLite loadable extensions, such as a uv-managed one:

```sh
uv venv --managed-python .venv
uv pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
uv pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e .
uv pip install --group dev
.venv/bin/delphi-code setup
```

## Code conventions

The aim is code a newcomer can read top to bottom without a guide.

**Layers.** Each folder is one layer, and dependencies point downward; `tests/test_layers.py` enforces the direction:

| Layer | Location | Knows about |
|---|---|---|
| Front end: CLI | `cli/` | `main.py` (argparse; picks the port implementations, calls one controller, writes its data as JSON or its views as text), `controllers/` (one function per command), `terminal/` (everything drawn on or asked in the terminal) |
| Front end: MCP | `mcp_server/` | `tools.py` defines one MCP tool per command except `connect` and `disconnect`, calls services directly and returns their data; `stdio_protocol.py` is JSON-RPC over stdio, no SDK |
| Services | `services/` | what a command does; each returns one typed result from `domain/`, the same for every front end. `application.py` (`DelphiCode`) is the one entrance: it holds the store, registry and model location and has one method per use case. The modules behind it: `indexing`, `searching`, `tracking`, `remote_repositories`, `project_catalog`, `model_installation`, `diagnostics`, `agent_connections`, plus the `Progress` port |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/` | disk, git, network and libraries: `store`, `registry`, `model`, `vector_index`, `files`, `sources`, `hosts`, `project_identity`, `model_assets`, `paths`, `offline`, `agent_configs` (each agent's MCP config file or CLI) |
| Domain | `domain/` | pure rules with no I/O: `errors`, `keys`, `manifest`, `selection`, `tracking_changes`, `agent_connection`, the results services return (`search_hits`, `indexing_outcomes`, `tracking_report`, `project_listing`, `index_state`, `diagnostics`), and `hosting_services` (`HostingService`, `Owner`, `Repository`: what front ends see of Bitbucket and GitHub, while `infrastructure/hosts.py` keeps the API clients) |

Front ends reach the core only through `DelphiCode` (built once per process with `DelphiCode.from_environment()`), `services.progress`, and `domain` types; the one other import is `infrastructure.log_file` to set up logging. They never import each other, except that `cli/main.py` starts the other front ends' servers through their `serve`, imported inside the command that runs them so the CLI never loads their libraries otherwise. Nothing below a front end imports it, and no module outside `cli/` sees an `argparse.Namespace`. `infrastructure/hosts.py` and `infrastructure/model_download.py` also run as standalone scripts in a separate process, so they never import package modules unconditionally (`hosts.py` imports `domain.errors` only under `if __package__`).

**Terminal UI.** Only `cli/terminal/` writes to the terminal. Controllers call one `DelphiCode` method and build views, importing only `terminal/views/`, `terminal/text_layout.py` and `TerminalProgress` from it; `TerminalProgress.showed_outcome_lines` tells them whether progress already printed each project's outcome, which no other front end needs to know. They depend on two ports instead of the terminal. `Progress` (`services/progress.py`) receives events and does nothing by default; `cli/terminal/progress.py` draws them. `Prompts` (`cli/controllers/repository_picking.py`) asks single questions; `cli/terminal/prompts.py` answers them in the terminal. A controller decides what is asked and when, gathers every decision first, and then calls one `DelphiCode` method such as `apply_picked_changes`, so services never ask. Each controller returns a `ControllerResponse` with the data for JSON output and the views for text output. `cli/terminal/` knows only `domain` and `services.progress` outside itself, so views read typed results.

**Interfaces.**
- Hide representations behind objects. Callers ask `manifest.ready` or `index.search(...)`; they never reach into JSON dicts or SQL.
- Pass domain types (`LocalModel`, `FileSelection`, `Checkout`, `Manifest`), not tuples or loose dicts. Results are frozen dataclasses whose `to_json()` is the one JSON shape every front end returns; dicts appear only there.
- A partly failed sync is a result, not an exception: `SyncReport` and `TrackingReport` hold each project's outcome, and each front end decides what a failure means (`failure_if_any_failed()` gives the CLI and MCP their `sync_failed` error).
- Anything a module does not export starts with `_`. Public functions and methods carry type hints.
- Constructors stay cheap; expensive work (loading the encoder, hashing) is lazy or explicit (`LocalModel.inspect`).

**Names over comments.** Make names carry the meaning and default to no comments or docstrings. Keep a comment only for a non-obvious *why* that no name can express. Replace magic values with named constants.

**Errors.** Raise `Failure(code, message, FailureKind.X)` from `errors.py`. `code` is the stable machine-readable identifier; `FailureKind` says what went wrong, not how a front end reports it: pick the kind that describes the cause (a project that does not exist is `NOT_FOUND`, a locked index is `BUSY`), and let each front end map it, such as `cli/terminal/output.py` to the exit codes in the README. The message tells the user how to recover.

**Tests.** Test behaviour through public seams: the CLI entry points, `LocalModel.inspect` (replaced by `tests/fakes.FakeModel`), and `services.indexing.index_checkout`. Do not patch private helpers. `tests/test_front_end_contract.py` runs the same commands through every front end and requires the same data and failure codes; add a row there for each new command.

**Style.** Ruff formats and lints (120 columns) and pyright type-checks the package. Run them before committing:

```sh
bash scripts/lint.sh
```

## Tests

Run the regular suite from the checkout root:

```sh
bash scripts/test.sh
```

It covers setup logic, project resolution, storage paths, model defaults, and cross-project ranking with real SQLite and mocked embeddings. It needs installed dependencies, but no prepared model or OS network sandbox, and makes no external requests; indexing and search still run under the Python network guard in `infrastructure/offline.py`. `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` runs the same suite.

Run the offline integration suite separately, on macOS with a prepared model:

```sh
export DELPHI_CODE_TEST_MODEL="$HOME/Library/Application Support/delphi-code/models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
bash scripts/test_offline.sh
```

Set `DELPHI_CODE_TEST_MODEL` to the actual model location; a model prepared inside the checkout can use `"$PWD/.models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`. Both scripts accept `DELPHI_CODE_PYTHON` to select a different Python executable.

The `tests/offline` suite launches real CLI subprocesses under OS network denial, uses an empty Hugging Face cache, and records Python DNS/connect attempts before runtime imports. It covers offline model import and reuse, missing models, doctor, actual retrieval, same-content reuse, preserved-mtime edits, deletion, ignore negation, filters, line numbers, empty results, and JSON output and exit codes. A separate socket probe verifies that the OS blocks networking. The directory is intentionally outside regular unittest discovery, so run both scripts for the full check. Neither suite tests live model downloads; CI does (see below).

## Claude Code plugin

The plugin lives in `plugin/` in two formats that share `skills/`: Claude Code's (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, listed by `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the repository root) and the open [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org) 1.0.0 format that Codex and Cursor read (`plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, listed for Codex by `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`). Keep the descriptions and server command in sync. `delphi_code/infrastructure/SKILL.md` is a copy of the plugin's skill that `connect` installs for agents without a plugin; a test fails when the two differ. Neither has a `version`, so users get each commit. Check Claude Code's with `claude plugin validate .` and try it with `claude --plugin-dir ./plugin`; check the portable files against the schemas in the [spec repository](https://github.com/agentplugins/agent-plugins-spec).

## Third-party notices

For a release that bundles dependencies, run `scripts/collect_notices.py` in the release environment and `scripts/prepare_notices.py` during online preparation. Both collect notices under `build/third_party/`; review them and include them with that release. See [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Releasing

The `Publish` GitHub Actions workflow builds and validates distributions on every push to `main`, then installs the wheel on macOS, runs an online `delphi-code setup`, both test suites, and a smoke test outside the checkout. A second macOS job installs the wheel through `scripts/install.sh` on a runner with an empty home directory and no uv, the way a new user would, then runs `--version`, `index`, `search`, and `doctor`. A release is published only when every check passes.

To release:

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` and push to `main`.
2. Once the workflow passes, push a matching tag, for example `git tag v0.1.1 && git push origin v0.1.1`. The tag must match the package version.

The tag run repeats the checks and publishes to PyPI through a Trusted Publisher (project `delphi-code`, owner `markdorof`, repository `delphi-code`, workflow `publish.yml`, environment `pypi`). Publishing uses GitHub OIDC; no stored PyPI token is needed. PyPI never accepts the same version twice.

After publishing, the tag run creates a GitHub Release with the distributions and `install.sh` attached and notes listing the commit subjects since the previous tag. Commit subjects are the changelog, so write them for users. Mention index format changes that need a rebuild in the release notes by editing the release afterwards.

`pyproject.toml` pins direct dependencies and bounds the risky indirect ones (torch, transformers, huggingface-hub, tokenizers), because `uv tool install` ignores `uv.lock`. Move those bounds when a new version has passed CI.
